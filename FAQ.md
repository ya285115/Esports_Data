**Q1: What kind of data is used in this project?**


Publicly available Formula 1 datasets, including race results, telemetry, lap times, pit stops, and weather data.

---
**Q2: Can I use this project with real-time telemetry feeds?**

Currently, the workflow supports historical data. Real-time integration is part of the future work roadmap.

---

**Q3: What are the main applications of this model?**

Lap time prediction.


Driver vs. constructor performance comparison.

Pit stop and strategy optimization.

Track-specific performance insights.

---
**Q4: Why is Formula 1 data challenging to model?**

Because race outcomes are influenced by a mix of technical (car setup, tire degradation, weather) and human (driver skill, strategy calls) factors, the data is highly multidimensional and dynamic.

---
**Q5: How accurate are the models?**


Baseline models achieve competitive performance on historical datasets. Accuracy varies by track, race conditions, and dataset granularity.

---
**Q6: Can I extend this project?**


Yes, by contributing additional data sources, experimenting with new ML models, or deploying dashboards.
