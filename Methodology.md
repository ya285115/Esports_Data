# Methodology

## Objective  
This project develops a predictive framework for Formula One data. The focus is on forecasting race outcomes and performance metrics using historical race and telemetry data. The system is designed to balance predictive accuracy with interpretability, robustness, and domain relevance.

## Data & Features  
- Inputs include lap times, sector times, pit stop records, tyre compounds, weather data, and driver/car performance metrics.  
- Feature engineering incorporates rolling averages, pace differentials, tyre degradation rates, and fuel-adjusted lap performance.  
- Missing or noisy telemetry values are handled with imputation techniques and anomaly detection filters.  

## Train / Validation Strategy  
- Data is split into training, validation, and test sets by race event to avoid leakage between sessions.  
- Cross-validation applied within seasons to measure consistency.  
- Monitoring includes gap between training and validation accuracy to detect overfitting.  

## Modeling  
- Benchmarks: linear regression and random forest models to establish a baseline.  
- Advanced methods: gradient boosting and ensemble approaches to capture nonlinear driver-car-track interactions.  
- Hyperparameter tuning applied via grid or random search.  
- Ablation analysis conducted to evaluate importance of tyres, weather, and pit stop variables.  

## Robustness & Reliability  
- Model tested on unseen race weekends to simulate out-of-distribution performance.  
- Stress tests applied for rare conditions such as safety car deployments, wet-to-dry transitions, and mechanical failures.  

## Explainability  
- SHAP values used to interpret lap time predictions (e.g., tyre compound contributed +0.3s/lap).  
- Local explanations provide driver-specific reasoning per race stint.  
- Global explanations highlight the relative influence of car setup, tyres, and track conditions.  

## Deployment Considerations  
- Inference pipeline optimized for low-latency predictions suitable for live race strategy simulations.  
- Logs and outputs structured for integration with dashboards and engineering decision systems.  

## Limitations & Future Work  
- Current version relies on historical datasets; live telemetry integration is pending.  
- Rare event handling (crashes, red flags) is limited due to small sample size.  
- Planned improvements: real-time inference server, multimodal fusion of video + telemetry, and stochastic race strategy simulation.
